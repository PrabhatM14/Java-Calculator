# Java-Calculator

This is a simple calculator that I code in java. Rather than just using this calculator in the terminal, it opens up a new window to a generic calculator with buttons once the code is ran. 

In order to run the code, cd into the directory in which the 'calc.java' file is located. Then compile it using 'javac calc.java', and run it with 'java calc'
